    当你敢睁开双眼,  
    真实没有想象的可怕。  
    当你相信自己说的每一句话，  
    你就不用担心别人是仰视还是俯视。  
    当你尊重自己，  
    别人就会尊重你。  
    当你打破那虚幻，  
    当你爬出来时，  
    你将不再惧怕深渊，  
    你就是深渊。

    When you dare to open your eyes,  
    The reality is not as terrifying as imagined.  
    When you believe in every word you say,  
    You don't have to worry about whether others look up or down on you.  
    When you respect yourself,  
    Others will respect you.  
    When you break the illusion,  
    When you climb out,  
    You will no longer fear the abyss,  
    You are the abyss.
